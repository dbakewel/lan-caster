    """The ServerMap implements several basic game mechanics.

    MOVE LINEAR MECHANIC
        Move a sprite along a linear path at a consent speed.
        Stops the sprite if it reaches the destination or
        any further movement would be invalid.

    MAPDOOR MECHANIC
        A mapDoor trigger can relocate a sprite to a new location
        (only if a valid location) on the same or different map.

    HOLDABLE MECHANIC
        Allows a sprite to request (using ACTION MECHANIC) to pickup
        and drop other sprites of type == holdable.

        Uses Mechanics: action, player action text

    ACTION MECHANIC
        Allows a sprite to request to perform some action during
        the next step. This request is only valid for one step.
        The action mechanic does nothing on it own. Other game
        mechanics can consume the action and perform some function.

    SPEECH TEXT MECHANIC
        Used by other game mechanics to show text above a
        sprite. Speech text only last one step or until
        a specific time after which it is removed.

    LABEL TEXT MECHANIC
        Used by other game mechanics to show text below a
        sprite. Label text remains until changed.

    PLAYER ACTION TEXT MECHANIC
        Used by other game mechanics to display available action
        to a player. (what will probably happen if player hits
        the action button.) This is removed at the start of
        each step and can only be set once per step (other
        attempts to set will be ignored.)

    PLAYER MARQUEE TEXT MECHANIC
        Used by other game mechanics to display marquee text
        to a player. Marquee text remains until changed.
