NAME
    engine.time - Game Time

DESCRIPTION
    This module replaces the python built in time module and
    adds a DELTA offset to the perf_counter function. This is
    used by the client to sync it's time with the server.
    With this, the client can evaluate time outs set by the
    server.

FUNCTIONS
    perf_counter()
        Returns float of current time in seconds.
        
        This is is not clock time and is only relative to itself.
        
        Returns:
            counter (float): time in seconds.
    
    set(serverTime)
        Sets DELTA to add to time to sync with serverTime.
        
        Args:
            serverTime (float): server time in seconds.
    
    sleep(sec=False, until=False)
        Function does not return until a specified time has passed.
        
        one of 'sec' or 'until' must be provided. 'sec' will
        use the OS sleep function while 'until' will busy 
        wait for greater accuracy.
        
        Args:
            sec (float): seconds to sleep.
            until (float): time to sleep until

DATA
