     |  
     |  dropHoldable(self, sprite)
     |      FLAT REFLECTOR MECHANIC: extend EXTEND HOLDABLE MECHANIC
     |      
     |      reset reflextor start position when dropped so it picks up where
     |      it was when it was picked up.
     |  
     |  initFlatReflector(self)
     |      FLAT REFLECTOR MECHANIC: init method.
     |      
     |      Set reflector half circle rotation speed in seconds
     |      Set all reflectors to a random rotation to start.
     |  
     |  initPush(self)
     |      PUSH MECHANIC: init method.
     |      
     |      Copy (by reference) all pushable sprites to the outOfBounds layer.
     |      
     |      Note, only part of pushable code included here so there are some objects 
     |      with collisionType == rect in this test map.
     |  
     |  initRayEmitter(self)
     |      RAY MECHANIC: init method
     |

     |      Takes collisions and reflectors into account.
     |      
     |      Returns a polyline dict of the form:
     |          [{"x":x1, "y":y1},{"x":x2, "y":y2},...]
     |      where all values are ralative to map orgin. To use in a polyline Object
     |      values must be converted so all points are relative to object x,y.

     |  Methods inherited from engine.servermap.ServerMap:
     |  
     |  addHoldableTrigger(self, holdable)
     |      HOLDABLE MECHANIC: copy holdable sprite and make it a trigger.
     |  
     |  delMoveLinear(self, sprite)
     |      MOVE LINEAR MECHANIC: Stop Sprite
     |      
     |      Remove attributes from sprite: move
     |  
     |  delSpriteAction(self, sprite)
     |      ACTION MECHANIC: clear sprite flag from sprite.
     |      
     |      This should be called whenever some code does something
     |      because of the action (the action is consumed). It
     |      should also be called at the end of the step is nothing
     |      could consume the action since action requests only
     |      last one step.
     |      
     |      Remove attributes to sprite: action
     |  
     |  delSpriteActionText(self, sprite)
     |      PLAYER ACTION TEXT MECHANIC: remove action text from player linked to sprite.
     |  
     |  delSpriteLabelText(self, sprite)
     |      LABEL TEXT MECHANIC: remove labelText from sprite.
     |      
     |      Remove attributes to sprite: labelText
     |  
     |  delSpriteMarqueeText(self, sprite)
     |      PLAYER MARQUEE TEXT MECHANIC: remove marquee text from player linked to sprite.
     |  
     |  delSpriteSpeechText(self, sprite)
     |      SPEECH TEXT MECHANIC: remove speechText from sprite.
     |      
     |      Remove attributes to sprite: speechText, speechTextDelAfter
     |  
     |  initAction(self)
     |      ACTION MECHANIC: init method.
     |      
     |      Set priority of stepMapEndAction to be very low so all other
     |      code has a chance to consume an action before it is removed.
     |  
     |  initHoldable(self)
     |      HOLDABLE MECHANIC: init method.
     |      
     |      holdable sprites need to be included in Tiled data on
     |      the sprites layer. This methods copies (by reference)
     |      sprites of type == "holdable" to the triggers layer. They
     |      are them on BOTH layers at the same time.
     |  
     |  initMapDoor(self)
     |      MAPDOOR MECHANIC: init method.
     |      
     |      Set the priority of mapDoor trigger to 1 (very high).
     |      This ensures a sprite goes through the mapDoor first
     |      and other triggers are stopped after the sprite moves.
     |  
     |  pickupHoldable(self, holdableTrigger, sprite)
     |      HOLDABLE MECHANIC: sprite picks up holdable.
     |      
     |      Add attributes to sprite: holding
     |  
     |  setMoveLinear(self, sprite, moveDestX, moveDestY, moveSpeed, slide=True)
     |      MOVE LINEAR MECHANIC: Set sprites destination and speed.
     |      
     |      Add attributes to sprite: move
     |  
     |  setSpriteAction(self, sprite)
     |      ACTION MECHANIC: flag sprite that it should perform one action.
     |      
     |      This is normally set in a player sprite after the server
     |      receives a playerAction message from client. Other game
     |      mechanics can look for an action request and perform
     |      some action based on this.
     |      
     |      This should be set before a steps starts or very early
     |      in a step since it will be removed at the end of the step
     |      and all step code should have a chance to see the action
     |      has been requested.
     |      
     |      Add attributes to sprite: action
     |  
     |  setSpriteActionText(self, sprite, actionText)
     |      PLAYER ACTION TEXT MECHANIC: add action text to player linked to sprite.
     |      
     |      Note, this will only work if sprite action text has not
     |      already been set during this step.
     |  
     |  setSpriteLabelText(self, sprite, labelText)
     |      LABEL TEXT MECHANIC: add labelText to sprite.
     |      
     |      Adds attributes to sprite: labelText
     |  
     |  setSpriteMarqueeText(self, sprite, marqueeText)
     |      PLAYER MARQUEE TEXT MECHANIC: add marquee text to player linked to sprite.
     |  
     |  setSpriteSpeechText(self, sprite, speechText, speechTextDelAfter=0)
     |      SPEECH TEXT MECHANIC: add speechText to sprite.
     |      
     |      Add attributes to sprite:
     |          speechText
     |          speechTextDelAfter (optional)
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          speechText (str): The text the sprite is speaking.
     |          speechTextDelAfter (float): time after which speechText will be
     |              removed. Default is to remove at start of next step.
     |  
     |  stepMapEndAction(self)
     |      ACTION MECHANIC: stepMapEnd method.
     |      
     |      If an action was requested but no step method was able to consume
     |      the action then simply delete the action (consume action it but do nothing).
     |  
     |  stepMapEndHoldable(self)
     |      HOLDABLE MECHANIC: stepMapEnd method.
     |      
     |      Drop holdable if sprite has holding and action is requested by user.
     |  
     |  stepMapStartActionText(self)
     |      PLAYER ACTION TEXT MECHANIC: delete action text from player linked to sprite.
     |      
     |      Each step the actions available may change so start each
     |      step by removing all action text. The first game mechanic
     |      that finds an action that could be performed can set a
     |      new action text.
     |  
     |  stepMapStartSpeechText(self)
     |      SPEECH TEXT MECHANIC: Remove speechText from sprite if it has timed out.
     |  
     |  stepMoveLinear(self, sprite)
     |      MOVE LINEAR MECHANIC: stepMove method.
     |      
     |      If the sprite is moving then move it towards it's destination. If it
     |      can't move any longer (all movement would be invalid) or it has reached
     |      it's destination then stop the sprite.
     |      
     |      Add attributes to sprite: direction
     |  
     |  triggerHoldable(self, holdableTrigger, sprite)
     |      HOLDABLE MECHANIC: trigger method.
     |      
     |      The sprite's anchor is inside the trigger.
     |      
     |      if the sprite is not holding anything now then:
     |          1) pick up holdable if the sprite has requested an action else
     |          2) tell the sprite the pick up action is possible.
     |  
     |  triggerMapDoor(self, trigger, sprite)
     |      MAPDOOR MECHANIC: trigger method
     |      
     |      Relocate sprite based on trigger properties.
     |      
     |      Trigger Properties:
     |          destMapName: The map to move the player to. If missing then
     |              do not change map.
     |          destReference: The name of an object on the destination map
     |              reference layer. This is the location the sprite will be
     |              moved to.
     |      
     |      If the sprite is relocated then this method returns True which
     |      stops other triggers from being processed for this sprite during
     |      the rest of this step. This makes sense since the sprite is no
     |      longer in the same location.
     |      
     |      Note, sprite will only be moved if destination is valid based
     |      on calling checkLocation().
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          True: if sprite was moved.
     |          None: if sprite did not move.

     |  Methods inherited from engine.stepmap.StepMap:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, tilesets, mapDir)
     |      Extents engine.map.Map.__init__()
     |      
     |      Finds and calls the init<MechanicName>() methods.
     |      Finds all methods that match each step method type format.
     |      Sorts all methods by type and priority.
     |  
     |  addStepMethodPriority(self, stepMethodType, stepMethodName, priority)
     |      Set the priority of a step method.
     |      
     |      This is normally used by subclass init* methods to prioritize step
     |      methods before finding and sorting them.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          stepMethodType (str): One of self['stepMethodPriority']
     |          stepMethodName (str): A method name that starts with stepMethodType
     |          priority (int): The priority of stepMethodName.Lower number is
     |              higher priority.
     |  
     |  getAllMethodsStr(self)
     |      Return a multi-line human readable string of all map init*, step*, and trigger* methods.
     |  
     |  getStatsAvgMs(self)
     |      Returns the avg ms to process each stepMap for this map.
     |  
     |  getTriggerMethodName(self, trigger)
     |      Convert a trigger type  to method
     |      
     |      eg. trigger['type'] == "mapDoor" would return "triggerMapDoor"
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          trigger (dict): Tiled object that is on this maps trigger layer.
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          str: The name of the method used to process the trigger.
     |  
     |  stepMap(self)
     |      Move the map forward one step in time
     |  
     |  stepTriggers(self, sprite)
     |      Process all triggers for a sprite.
     |      
     |      Find all triggers (objects on the trigger layer) that contain this
     |      sprite's anchor and call the corresponding trigger* method.
     |      
     |      The search excludes the sprite itself from the search
     |      since objects may be on the sprite and trigger layer at the
     |      same time.
     |      
     |      A trigger may optionally contain an array of sprite references.
     |      Sprites in that list will not set off the trigger:
     |      e.g. trigger['doNotTrigger'] = [sprite1, sprite2, ...]
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          sprite (dict): Tiled object from the sprite layer.
     |

     |  Methods inherited from engine.map.Map:
     |  
     |  __str__(self)
     |      Return str(self).
     |  
     |  addFollower(self, leaderObject, followerObject)
     |      Add leaderObject/followerObject relationship to self['follow']
     |      This also records the relative position of the objects.
     |      
     |      This information is used by setObjectLocationByAnchor() and setObjectMap()
     |      and causes the followerObject to follow the position of the leaderObject.
     |      
     |      Once a followerObject has been added it should not longer be used with
     |      setObjectLocationByAnchor() or setObjectMap(), only the leaderObject
     |      should.
     |  
     |  addObject(self, object, objectList=False)
     |      Add a Tiled object to an object list.
     |      
     |      Used to add Tiled objects (e.g. sprites) to the object list of a layer.
     |      The default objectList is self['sprites'].
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): Tiled object
     |          objectList (dict): An objectList from a layer on this map.
     |  
     |  checkKeys(self, object, props)
     |      Check if all props are keys in object.
     |      
     |      This can be used by a method to check if an object has all the
     |      data required. If data is missing then a warning
     |      is logged that suggests where the data may be missing from.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): Tiled object
     |          props (list): A list of keys. e.g. ["prop-deltaX", "anchorX"]
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          bool: True if all props are in object else False
     |  
     |  checkLocation(self, object, newAnchorX, newAnchorY, ignoreInBounds=False)
     |      Check if a location for an object is valid.
     |      
     |      Determines if (newAnchorX, newAnchorY) would be a valid anchor point for
     |      object while taking several things into account, including map size, inBounds layer,
     |      and outOfBounds layer, collision with other sprites.
     |      
     |      Note, the priority evaluation is as follows:
     |      1) if object collides (overlaps) with another sprite then it is NOT valid.
     |         Note, two objects with collisionType == 'anchor' are allowed in the same location.
     |      2) if object does not fully collide (overlap) with the map then it is NOT valid.
     |      3) if object collides (overlaps) with an object on the outOfBounds layer then it is NOT valid.
     |      4) if the inBounds layer is empty or ignoreInBounds == True then it IS valid
     |      5) if object is fully inside an object or objects on the inBounds layer then it IS valid.
     |      6) else it is NOT valid.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): A Tiled object.
     |          newAnchorX (float): x coordiate to check if valid
     |          newAnchorY (float): y coordiate to check if valid
     |          ignoreInBounds (bool): if True then do not consider inBounds layers (default False)
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          bool: True if an anchor point of (newAnchorX, newAnchorY) would be a valid for object, else False
     |  
     |  checkObject(self, object)
     |      Check that object has required keys.
     |      
     |      Ensure object meets all basic criteria that are required by the server.
     |      If an empty object ({}) is passed then it is populated with default
     |      values until it meets the minimum requirements of a Tiled object.
     |      
     |      The minimum object contains:
     |      {
     |          'name': (str)
     |          'type': (str)
     |          'x': (float)
     |          'y': (float)
     |          'width': (float)
     |          'height': (float)
     |          'anchorX': (float)
     |          'anchorY': (float)
     |          'collisionType': (str) One of 'none', 'anchor', 'rect', 'circle'
     |          'mapName': (str) The last map the object was on (or is still on).
     |      
     |          Only for tile objects have the following:
     |          'gid': (int) Map Global Tile ID.
     |          'tilesetName': (str) Tile Tileset Name.
     |          'tilesetTileNumber': (int) Tileset Tile Number.

     |      
     |      Returns:
     |          object (dict): Object is both edited in place and also returned.
     |  
     |  convertTiledColor(self, tiledColor)
     |      Convert Tiled color HEX format to pygame format.
     |      
     |      Tiled hex colors with alpha are '#AARRGGBB' format but pygame
     |      needs '#RRGGBBAA' so flip alpha to the end.
     |  
     |  convertTiledProps(self, object)
     |      Convert Tiled properties to easy to use format.
     |      
     |      If 'properties' is in object then remove it and
     |      add prop-<name> to object for each property in
     |      'properties'.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          object (dict): An object to evaluate.
     |  
     |  findGid(self, tilesetSearchName, tilesetTileSearchNumber)
     |      Converts a tileset specific tile number to a Gid of this map.
     |      
     |      This requires that tilesetSearchName is a tileset in this map!
     |      
     |      Args:
