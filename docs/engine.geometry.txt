NAME
    engine.geometry - Geometry Utility Functions.

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides several using geometry functions that can be used
    with Tiled objects and object lists.
    
    Note, all angles below are in radians, starting a 3 oclock and increasing clockwise.
    You can convert between degrees and radians in your code as follows:
    
        import math
        r = math.radians(d)
        d = math.degrees(r)

CLASSES

    class Vector2D(builtins.object)
     |  Vector2D(x, y)
     |  
     |  A two-dimensional vector with Cartesian coordinates.

     |  Based on https://scipython.com/book2/chapter-4-the-core-python-language-ii/examples/a-2d-vector-class/
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __abs__(self)
     |      Absolute value (magnitude) of the vector. i.e. ||self||
     |  
     |  __add__(self, other)
     |      Vector addition.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, x, y)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |  
     |  __matmul__ = dot(self, other)
     |  
     |  __mod__(self, scalar)
     |      One way to implement modulus operation: for each component.
     |  
     |  __mul__(self, scalar)
     |      Multiplication of a vector by a scalar.
     |  
     |  __neg__(self)
     |      Negation of the vector (invert through origin.)
     |  
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Unambiguous string representation of the vector.
     |  
     |  __rmul__(self, scalar)
     |      Reflected multiplication so vector * scalar also works.
     |  
     |  __str__(self)
     |      Human-readable string representation of the vector.
     |  
     |  __sub__(self, other)
     |      Vector subtraction.
     |

     |      The distance between vectors self and other.
     |  
     |  dot(self, other)
     |      The scalar (dot) product of self and other. Both must be vectors.
     |  
     |  ortho(self)
     |      Return a vector that is orthogonal.
     |  
     |  project(self, other)
     |      Return a vector that is the vector projected onto other.

     |  reflect(self, other)
     |      Return a vector that is reflected off other.
     |      
     |      Unlike other reflect code. The vector being reflected starts
     |      being pointed at other. The returned vector points away
     |      from other.

FUNCTIONS
    angle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        Returns angle from (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in radians.
    
    angleLabel(a)
        Returns the label ('Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right') of angle a
    
    collides(o1, o2, overlap='partial', o1CollisionType=False, o2CollisionType=False)
        Returns True if o1 overlaps o2 else returns False.
        
        Valid collisionType values are 'none', 'anchor', 'line', rect', and circle.
        
        Args:
            o1, o2 (dict): These are game objects which must contain at least: x, y, width, 
                height, anchoX, anchorY, and collisionType.
            overlap (str): overlap must be one of 'partial' or 'full'.
                If overlap == 'partial' then collides() returns True if any part of o1
                and o2 overlap. If overlap == 'full' the collides only returns True if
                o2 fully overlaps o1 (i.e. o1 is fully inside o2).
            o1CollisionType (bool, str): If False then use o1['collisionType']. If str
                then use o1CollisionType in place of o1['collisionType'].
            o2CollisionType (bool, str): If False then use o2['collisionType']. If str
                then use o2CollisionType in place of o2['collisionType'].
        Returns:
            Boolean.
    
    collidesFast(o1, o1CollisionType, o2, o2CollisionType, overlap='partial')
        Fast version of collides() with no error checking.
        
        Valid collisionType values are 'none', 'anchor', 'line', rect', and circle.
        
        If collisionType == 'line' then object must contain a polyline or polygon.
        
        The only supported collisionType combinations are:
            o1CollisionType     o1CollisionType
            ---------------     ---------------

            overlap (str): overlap must be one of 'partial' or 'full'.
                If overlap == 'partial' then collides() returns True if any part of o1
                and o2 overlap. If overlap == 'full' the collides only returns True if
                o2 fully overlaps o1 (i.e. o1 is fully inside o2).
